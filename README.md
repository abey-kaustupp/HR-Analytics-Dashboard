# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
This project is an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard developed using Power BI to provide actionable insights into key workforce metrics. The dashboard visualizes data on employee count, attrition rates, average age, salary distribution, and years of service, with detailed analyses across education levels, age groups, salary ranges, and job roles.

Key features include:
# Dynamic slicers for filtering by department, gender, education, and other demographics
# Visualizations of attrition trends and workforce distribution
# Custom design elements like transparent slicer buttons for an enhanced user experience

The dashboard is designed to help HR teams identify patterns in employee attrition and make data-driven decisions to improve retention and overall organizational performance.
